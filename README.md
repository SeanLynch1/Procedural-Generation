# Project Description
This project contains a proceduarlly generated city, that can be modified by use of the implemented UI. It consists of tiles which generates blocks forming towers in the loop of a iterating circle and based on certain positions within a road network. There is a ship which the user can use to navigate around the city and closely look at all the different implementations and beautiful colours.

# Instructions
In the game there is a canvas containing UI elements which guides the user on what they can do. Using different controls explained within canvas the player can yaw, pitch, roll, elevate and strafe their ship. If the user right click's the mouse they will freeze the ships position and activate a second canvas which allows them to modify the individual rotation of each block in the city towers, the spacing between each block in each tower, the activity of each block in each tower and the rotation of every tower at once.

# How It Works
The terrain is procedurally generated by creating a grid of vertice positions. Then within a for loop three vertices within the grid of all the vertices are located at a time and using these three points a mesh is quadrant mesh is created to form a triangle. A second triangle is then created to form a square. This process is repeated in a nested for loop causing a grid of these squares. Then using perlin noise the height of each triangle is generated based on the shade of what would be a perlin noise texture. The grey scale of the texture determines the height and depth of each triangle  forming an organic look terrain. 

Multiple tiles can be formed in multiple loops in the shape of a circle using the formula for the circuference of a circle along with sin and cos functions to calculate the individual placement for each tile in each circle loop that is created. Each tile then generates a random height and instantiates a randomised block starting at 0 and recursively repeating reaching the max height. A roof top piece is then instantiated at the max height of the tower.

'public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}'

# Initial Proposal
This repository will contain the source files and code on my journey of trying to create a 3D procedurally generated city.

I plan to procedurally generate buildings in a city using recursion. The position of each building may be random or manually assigned. Each layer of the building will be instantiated with a prefab. My goal is to try and model these prefabs myself however I don't have much experience in this area. I plan for the top layer of the buildings to use perlin noise. This will randomise the height of the roofs giving an undulating look to them. Depending on time and on the complexity of things I also may use fractals to instantiate additonal prefabs on the sides of base prefabs that make up the different layers of recursion. This will add diversity and uniqueness to the city. Hopefully I can generate a quasi random terran using perlin noise to surround the city and give an all round immersing feeling to the city. The scene may be interactive, allowing players to adjust the height of buildings and the offset, scale etc of the perlin noise and I could possibly implement some sort of moving character with a goal too.

I feel like the building positions will be assigned by a base tile that is assigned manually within a for loop or randomly using a different method that decides wether to place a tile or a nullable object in each sections of a grid. The recursion layers can be generated using for loops with randomised maximum iteration amounts. They could possibly randomly select different prefabs from an array. For the fractals I could try right a rule set that tells prefabs to instantiate corresponding prefabs on their sides/edges. I could randomly set the offset of a perlin noise texture for random height generation of terain/ rooftops that players can adjust with a slider or something along those lines as well.
